# An-Analysis-of-Rectangular-Arrays-in-Chinese-Mathematics

The paper recounts and revises the development of linear albegra system from ancient
Chinese referenced on the acient Chinese text: The Nine Chapters on the Mathematical Art.
The two main related Chapter that will be examined are: “Excess and Deficits” and “The
Fangcheng Procedure” in both their mathematical concepts and some representitive questions.
Furthermore, this paper will compare mordern approaches on linear algebra system to the
ancient Chinese strategies, finding potential insight that reveals the process of how mathematics
evolved.
